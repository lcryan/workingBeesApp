## Welcome to the WorkingBeesHub 

This is the WorkingBeesHub project I made as a final project for my backend study

## 1. About the application 

At "WorkingBeesHub," companies can rent office, meeting, and conference rooms for a specified period. Companies can register with multiple teams for different spaces by signing lease subscriptions for a certain period. All companies can create an account through the system and manage their business and team details.

For the construction of this application, I have chosen two user roles: 1. The hub 2. The company. The hub and the customer company can use the app in different ways:

## 2. The user roles and their features

**User 1: The Hub (ADMIN authorization)**

The hub can add customer companies, entering the company name, team name, company contact information, payment details, and the type of subscription.
The hub can add subscriptions with different prices, types of spaces, and the duration of each company's subscription.
The hub can also add teams for each company. For each team, the name, size, and required services (such as catering, receptionist, mail service, etc.) must be entered. A team is always linked to a company.

**User 2: The Company (USER authorization)**

The company can view the company and team details, including the subscription price.
Each company has only one subscription, which includes all spaces, teams, and extra services.
Each company can also view all costs for spaces and extra services on the subscription, including an overview of the total subscription amount.
Each company can make changes to its own details. Furthermore, a customer company can also modify the details of its team or teams.
Each company can add one or more teams to its business.
Each company can add extra services to its teams.
Each company can also add one space per team.
